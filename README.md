# Tristyn Eddie Watkins-Sanchez - Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio! This portfolio showcases a collection of my most significant projects, including my latest work on AI technologies, web development, and UX/UI design. Through this repository, you'll get a glimpse into my journey as a self-taught programmer, my problem-solving skills, and my passion for building impactful digital solutions.

## About Me

I'm Tristyn, a passionate self-taught programmer with over eight years of hands-on experience in HTML and a burgeoning expertise in Python. My programming journey began out of necessity when I stepped up to create and manage websites for companies lacking in digital presence. This challenge led me to grow a team, eventually taking on significant managerial roles before circling back to my first love: coding. With a solid background in psychology and art, I bring a unique perspective to understanding user needs and crafting intuitive interfaces.
